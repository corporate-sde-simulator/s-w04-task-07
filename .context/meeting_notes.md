# Meeting Notes - Sprint 26 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Neha Sharma (Lead), Amit Kumar, Intern

---

## Notification preference manager

- **Neha Sharma:** This is blocking our release. Amit Kumar started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Amit Kumar:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `preferenceManager.ts` and `channelRouter.ts`
- [ ] @Amit Kumar - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Neha Sharma - Final sign-off before merge
